# 🌀 Spiral Matrix Generator

This project is a **C program** that allows users to **generate, save, and load**  spiral matrices of sizes between **1x1 and 20x20**.  
It was developed as part of a **university assignment at ELTE**.

## 📜 Features

- ✅ **Generate spiral matrices**
- ✅ **Choose direction:** left, right, up, or down
- ✅ **Save matrices** to a text file
- ✅ **Load matrices** from a text file
- ✅ **Print matrices** in a formatted way
- ✅ **User-friendly menu interface**

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Run the program.
2. Choose an option from the **interactive menu**:
   - `0` - View the **user guide**
   - `1` - **Generate** a new matrix
   - `2` - **Save** the current matrix
   - `3` - **Load** a matrix from a file
   - `4` - **Print** the current matrix
   - `5` - **Exit** the program
3. When generating a matrix:
   - **Choose a size** (between `1-20`)
   - **Select a starting direction** (`left`, `right`, `up`, `down`)
   - **Specify rotation** (`ccw` – counterclockwise)
4. View, save, or load your matrix as needed!
